\section{Outline and Contributions}

As an output of this work, some contributions were made to the field of
\gls{ISS} in medical images. The main contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A novel loss function for \gls{ISS} tasks in medical images capable of
    inferring the best possible segmentation and codifying the
    reliability of the labelers without needing separate inputs about
    the labeler performance or multiple networks to be trained.
  \item A Chained Deep Learning model for \gls{ISS} tasks in medical
    images, which can learn from inconsistent labels and improve the
    segmentation performance outperforming state of the art
    approaches on a Triple Negative Breast Cancer histopathology dataset.
  \item A mechanism for noisy annotations emulations by using networks
    encoding layers weight disturbance for building crowdsourced
    version of the well known Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.
  \item A python package for using the proposed loss function and
    architecture in \gls{CNN} models for \gls{ISS} tasks in medical images.

  \item Triple negative breast cancer and Oxford-IIIT Pet Datasets
    mapping as lazy loaders for the proposed loss function ready to go in
    the package.

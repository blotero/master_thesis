\chapter{Chained deep learning for image
segmentation}\label{ch:chained_deep_learning_seg}

\section{Introduction}

As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, U-shaped \glspl{CNN} have been
proven a good solution for segmentation tasks in medical images, due to their
ability to capture both global and local information with relatively low
datasets.

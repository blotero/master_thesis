I would like to express my deepest gratitude to:

My beloved Camila, for her unwavering love, support, and patience
throughout this journey.

My family, especially my parents, for their unconditional support
during challenging times. I look forward to sharing many more joyful
moments together.

My advisors, Prof. Andrés Marino Álvarez-Meza, Prof. Julián Gil, and
Prof. Germán Castellanos-Domínguez, for their invaluable guidance and
mentorship.

My friends and colleagues at GCPDS, particularly Lucas, Santiago,
Marcos, and Rafael, for their support and camaraderie throughout this
academic journey.

The Universidad Nacional de Colombia, for providing the resources and
facilities that enabled me to pursue this Master's degree. I hope
this work contributes meaningfully to the field of early cancer detection.
